# Pseudopigrapha

(This repository was formerly known as ["Tweaks-o-Thaumaturgist: Tweaking minecraft mods with Minetweaker to suit Thaumcraft-style!"][link-old], intending to collect scripts used by this modpack; however it is now adapted to host files related to this modpack.)

... is a 1.7.10 modpack that focuses on Thaumcraft *to a great extent*. Imagine a world where you cannot live without Thaumcraft. Everything, including your electric machines, are made from thaumaturgical products. What could go wrong with it?

The modpack started in late-2015; however due to lack of time there has not been new progress in recent years..  
Keep eyes on this repo; it may receive updates in the future.

### Side note

  1. `mod_list` contains SHA256 checksum of all jar files used in this modpack.
