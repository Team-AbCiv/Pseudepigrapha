# Pseudopigrapha

... is a 1.7.10 modpack that focuses on Thaumcraft *to a great extent*. Imagine a world where you cannot live without Thaumcraft. Everything, including your electric machines, are made from thaumaturgical products. What could go wrong with it?

The modpack started in late-2015; however due to lack of time it has been WIP since then.  
Keep eyes on this repo; it may receive updates in the future.

### Side note

  1. `mod_list` contains SHA256 checksum of all jar files used in this modpack.
